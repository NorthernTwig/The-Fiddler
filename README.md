# THE FIDDLER

### What is this?
It is a community-driven fidget spinner which feeds on sockets. 

### What does that mean?
Basically, it is a virtual fidget spinner which you can **spin** and **drag** - but you will have to share, since there is only one fidget spinner.

### Why?
I needed something to do in order to learn some Elixir, and came up with this. Which in turn ended up being quite fun.
